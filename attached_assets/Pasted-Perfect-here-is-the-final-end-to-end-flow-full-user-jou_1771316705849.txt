Perfect — here is the final, end-to-end flow + full user journey for your platform, fully aligned with everything we discussed:
Role-based access (Admin, Supervisor, Agent, Custom Roles)
Supervisor optional
Admin inherits supervisor capabilities but is not in operational routing
AI → Agent → Supervisor escalation logic
Live Ops, Voice, WebRTC, Co-Pilot
Outbound calls + Transcripts + KB
This is the clean, production-grade flow you can give to design, product, and engineering.
🟦 1. USER ROLES & WHAT THEY SEE
Client Admin
Full platform owner
Sees All screens, All settings
Has ALL Supervisor capabilities (monitor, whisper, barge)
Not included in routing or agent queues
Supervisor (Optional Role)
Team manager
Handles team monitoring, dashboards, outbound, KB
Receives escalations only if configured, otherwise escalations go to Agents
Agent
Only sees their assigned conversations
Can handle voice & chat
Uses Co-Pilot
Cannot monitor or see others
Custom Roles
Sales Agent
Support Agent
Permission-based filtered views.
🟦 2. SYSTEM ENTRY FLOW
Step 1: Login
User logs in → system reads their roleId → loads permissions into session.
Step 2: Sidebar Auto-Config
Sidebar only shows screens with View permission.
Examples:
Agent does NOT see Analytics, Flow Builder, Integrations, Outbound
Supervisor DOES see Outbound, Analytics, KB edit
Admin sees EVERYTHING
Step 3: Role Switcher (for internal testing)
Admin can test any role by switching roles → session is rebuilt.
🟦 3. LIVE OPS (VOICE + CHAT) — MAIN USER JOURNEY
This is the core of your platform.
🎯 Customer starts a conversation
Customer initiates:
Chat widget
WebRTC call
Phone number (PSTN → SIP → WebRTC)
WhatsApp
Instagram
Facebook
Email
AI Agent takes over first
AI handles as long as:
Model confidence is high
User not frustrated
No escalation trigger
🟦 4. AI → HUMAN ESCALATION FLOW
AI decides escalation is needed → triggers routing:
Routing Logic:
If Supervisor exists & is enabled for this queue → send to Agent (preferred).
Escalation ALWAYS goes to Agent unless explicitly configured otherwise.
If agent unavailable → round-robin to another agent.
If no agents → wait queue.
Admin is NEVER added to routing automatically.
🟦 5. AGENT JOURNEY (assigned a conversation)
Agent receives a new conversation:
Agent UI:
Middle: Live Chat / Voice Call
Left: My Conversations
Right: AI Co-Pilot
Bottom: Message composer or voice controls
Agent can:
✔ Respond
✔ View transcript
✔ View customer history
✔ Trigger actions (refund, booking, ticket creation)
✔ Put AI back in control (handover back to bot)
✔ End conversation
Agent CANNOT:
❌ See other agents
❌ Transfer to other agents
❌ Monitor anyone
❌ Whisper or barge
❌ Export analytics
🟦 6. SUPERVISOR JOURNEY (team manager)
If a Supervisor exists:
Supervisor Live Ops Screen:
Agent list with status (Online, Busy, Break)
Active conversations overview
SLA monitoring
Queue monitoring
Escalation queue
Whisper
Barge in
Take over
Transfer conversation
Supervisor handles:
✔ Team management
✔ Real-time operations
✔ Outbound campaigns
✔ KB (create/edit)
✔ Analytics exports
Supervisor CANNOT:
❌ Change billing
❌ Change role permissions
❌ Manage integrations
❌ Change channel settings
🟦 7. ADMIN JOURNEY (platform owner)
Admin can:
✔ Do everything a Supervisor can
✔ Manage roles
✔ Manage billing
✔ Manage integrations
✔ Manage security
✔ Manage SDKs
✔ Manage channels
✔ Publish flows
✔ Create AI agents
✔ Create supervisors & agents
Admin DOES NOT:
❌ Receive escalations
❌ Get added to agent queues
Admin only monitors or intervenes manually.
🟦 8. VOICE CALL FLOW (WEBRTC)
Customer calls (through web or phone)
Call hits voice connector
Forwarded to AI Voice Agent
AI handles intent
If escalation:
WebRTC panel rings for Agent
Agent answers on web browser
Supervisor can silently monitor
Admin can also monitor
Voice Controls:
Mute (Agent)
Mute (Customer) — AI can
Hold
End Call
Transfer (supervisor only)
Whisper/Barge (supervisor/admin only)
🟦 9. TRANSCRIPTS & REPORTING JOURNEY
Every conversation produces:
Transcript
Summary (AI Co-Pilot generated)
Sentiment timeline
Intent mapping
Agent actions
Access:
Agent (view)
Supervisor (view/export)
Admin (view/export/delete)
🟦 10. OUTBOUND CALLS JOURNEY
Supervisor or Admin can create outbound campaigns
Agents only handle calls assigned to them
Outbound Campaign Creation:
Upload list
Choose AI / human routing
Schedule
Monitor real-time results
🟦 11. KNOWLEDGE BASE JOURNEY
Agent → View only
Supervisor → View + Create + Edit
Admin → Full access
🟦 12. COMPLETE USER JOURNEY (CONCISE SUMMARY)
Here is the holistic flow:
Customer → AI → (Escalate) → Agent → Supervisor (optional) → Admin (backup only)
Customer
→ interacts
AI
→ handles first
→ summarizes context
→ triggers escalation only when needed
Agent
→ receives assigned task
→ uses co-pilot
→ handles end-to-end
Supervisor (if exists)
→ oversees team
→ monitors calls
→ manages queue
→ supports agents
Admin
→ system owner
→ not in routing
→ monitors when needed
