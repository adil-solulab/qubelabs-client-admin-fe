Below is a clear, structured explanation of the difference between Supervisor View vs Agent View, and the exact UI/UX + functional flow both should have — especially in a voice + chat AI agent inbox system like Yellow.ai.
This is the same structure used in industry platforms: Yellow.ai, Zendesk, Freshdesk, Five9, Genesys.
✅ 1. Roles & What They Can See
A. Agent View (Individual Support Agent)
This user handles only their own calls/chats.
They do not manage other agents.
Agent can see:
Their assigned conversations (voice + chat)
AI to Human escalated tickets assigned to them
Their performance stats (optional, limited)
Co-Pilot assistant (reply suggestions, actions, call summaries)
Their own call history
Their own availability status (Online / Break / Busy)
WebRTC panel to receive calls
Agent cannot see:
Other agents’ performance
Routing rules
Team-wide analytics
Monitoring and barging options
Bulk outbound campaigns
B. Supervisor View (Team Lead / Manager)
This user manages multiple agents.
Supervisor can see:
All agents' activity
Live dashboards:
Total active chats
Total active voice calls
AI handled vs Agent handled
SLA breaches
Each agent’s:
Live status
Current call/chat
Queue length
Monitor agent calls (silent listening)
Barge into a call (speak if needed)
Take Over a call
Transfer calls between agents
Team performance analytics:
AHT (Average Handling Time)
CSAT
Resolution rate
Queue times
Supervisor cannot:
Edit system-wide settings (unless also Admin)
Change integrations, routing, SDK config
 
FLOW 1: AI Handles → Human Agent Escalation
Customer starts chat/voice
AI Agent handles initial conversation
AI determines: "Escalation needed"
Routing engine assigns conversation to an Agent
Agent sees:
Live transcript
Context summary
Conversation history
Co-Pilot suggestions
Agent handles the call/chat
Supervisor sees this in real-time but does not interfere unless needed.
FLOW 2: Agent Needs Supervisor Help (Internal Escalation)
From the Agent’s screen:
Request Supervisor
Mark conversation as Escalated
Optionally: ask a supervisor privately via internal note
Supervisor receives:
Notification
Option to monitor → whisper → take over
FLOW 3: Supervisor Monitors the Team
Supervisor dashboard shows:
Live Queue
How many calls waiting
How many agents online
Live Conversations
For each agent:
Name
Current call duration
Sentiment
SLA status
AI vs human handling
Supervisor can:
Monitor (silent)
Whisper (only agent hears)
Barge (join conversation)
Take Over (become primary handler)
FLOW 4: Outbound Voice Campaigns (Supervisor Only)
Only supervisor sees:
Campaign creation
Contact lists
Progress
Completion rates
AI vs Agent follow-ups
Agents only see:
Calls assigned to them from outbound queue
