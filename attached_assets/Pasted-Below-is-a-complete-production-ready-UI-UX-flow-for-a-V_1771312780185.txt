Below is a complete, production-ready UI/UX flow for a Voice Agent Inbox, based on how Yellow.ai, Zendesk, Intercom, Talkdesk, and Freshworks design their voice modules — but adapted to your architecture where voice comes through WebRTC + Connectors.
This is exactly what your design + dev team needs.
