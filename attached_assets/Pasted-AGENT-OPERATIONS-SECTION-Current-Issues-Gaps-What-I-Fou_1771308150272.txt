AGENT OPERATIONS SECTION - Current Issues & Gaps
What I Found on Your Platform:
Your Live Operations page shows: - Basic conversation list with status (Active, Waiting, Escalated) - Simple metrics (Active, In Queue, Available, Avg Wait, Longest) - Limited filtering options (Channel, Status, Sentiment) - One escalated conversation visible (Sarah Johnson - Technical Issue)
What's Missing Compared to Yellow.ai:
Feature	Yellow.ai Implementation	Your Platform Status
Agent Status Management	4 statuses: Available, Busy, Away, Offline with clear business logic	Basic status shown, no management
Real-time Supervisor View	Live monitoring of all group conversations with instant updates	Static list view
Chat Categorization	My Chats, Active Chats, Queued Chats, Open Chats, Resolved, Missed	Only basic status filter
Agent Concurrency Control	Configurable max concurrent chats per agent	Not visible
Queue Management	Visual queue with wait times and priority	Basic "In Queue" count
SLA Monitoring	Real-time SLA breach warnings with timestamps	Basic alert shown
Critical Gap - Agent Status Workflow:
Yellow.ai's Approach:
Available → Can receive new chats
Busy → No new chats, but can be manually transferred to
Away → No new chats, but remains in queue (not missed)
Offline → No assignment, chats become missed if offline queue disabled
Your Platform: - Shows status but lacks the workflow logic behind it - No clear escalation path when agents are Busy/Away - Missing "Away" status distinction (crucial for lunch breaks)
2. TEAM CREATION - Structural Issues
What I Found on Your Platform:
Your Users & Team Management shows: - 8 Total Users (1 Admin, 2 Supervisors, 5 Agents) - Skills assigned to users (Technical Support, Billing, Sales, etc.) - Departments assigned - Status tracking
What's Missing - The "Groups" Concept:
Yellow.ai's Team Structure:
Inbox Admin
    └── Groups (Support, Escalation, Billing, etc.)
            ├── Group Supervisor
            └── Agents (with skills)
Critical Missing Elements:
NO GROUPS/TEAMS STRUCTURE
Yellow.ai requires agents to be organized into Groups
Each group has a dedicated supervisor
Chats are routed to specific groups based on intent
Your platform assigns skills to individuals but lacks group-based routing
NO SUPERVISOR-TO-GROUP MAPPING
Yellow.ai: Supervisors are assigned to specific groups
They only see chats from their group
Your platform: Supervisors seem to have global visibility (inefficient)
MISSING GROUP-SPECIFIC SETTINGS:
Group email ID for ticket creation
Group-specific working hours
Group-level auto-assignment rules
Group queue configuration
Recommended Team Structure for Your Platform:
Customer Support Group
├── Supervisor: Sarah Mitchell
└── Agents: Michael Chen, David Kim
Escalation Group
├── Supervisor: Lisa Park
└── Agents: James Wilson
Sales Group
└── Agent: Emily Rodriguez
VIP Support Group
└── Agent: James Wilson
3. ESCALATION FLOW - Critical Gaps in Flow Builder
What I Found on Your Platform:
Your Flow Builder shows: - 6 flows total (5 published, 1 draft) - Categories: Base, FAQs, Operations - "Customer Support Flow" (Voice) - Main flow - "Handle Customer" (Chat) - Customer inquiry handling and routing - No visible escalation-specific flow
What's Missing - Escalation Flow Components:
Yellow.ai's Escalation Flow:
1. Intent Detection → "chat with agent" / "speak to human"
2. Raise Live Chat Request → Send to Inbox
3. Auto-Assignment Logic:
   - Check agent availability
   - Check concurrency limits
   - Check last assigned time
   - Route to appropriate group
4. Queue Management:
   - If no agent available → Queue
   - If queue full → Missed chat
5. Context Transfer:
   - Pass conversation history
   - Pass user details
   - Pass custom fields (Order ID, etc.)
6. Agent Handoff:
   - Agent receives chat with context
   - Can transfer to another agent/group
   - Can resolve with required fields
Critical Missing Elements in Your Flow Builder:
NO ESCALATION TRIGGER NODE
Missing node to detect escalation intent
Should trigger on: "speak to agent", "transfer to human", negative sentiment
NO GROUP ROUTING LOGIC
Your flows don't route to specific agent groups
Should route: Billing → Billing Group, Technical → Support Group
NO AGENT AVAILABILITY CHECK
Before escalating, check if agents are available
If not, provide fallback (callback, email ticket, queue)
NO CONTEXT TRANSFER
Escalated chats should include:
Full conversation transcript
User profile data
Intent classification
Priority level
Custom fields (Order ID, Account #)
NO QUEUE MANAGEMENT FLOW
What happens when no agents available?
Yellow.ai options:
Queue with wait time estimate
Offer callback
Create email ticket
Provide self-service alternative
4. AI CALL ESCALATION - Voice-Specific Gaps
What's Missing for Voice Escalation:
NO VOICE-TO-HUMAN HANDOFF FLOW
Your platform shows 5 active voice calls
No visible flow for transferring AI voice call to human agent
MISSING VOICE-SPECIFIC LOGIC:
Sentiment-based escalation (frustrated customer)
Intent-based escalation (complex query)
Failed recognition escalation (3 failed attempts)
NO CALLBACK QUEUE INTEGRATION
Your Callbacks section shows 3 pending
Should be integrated into escalation flow
ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
Immediate Actions (High Priority):
Create Groups in User Management
Add "Groups" section under Management
Allow creating groups: Support, Escalation, Billing, Sales
Assign supervisors to groups
Add agents to groups (agents can be in multiple groups)
Implement Agent Status Workflow
Add 4 statuses: Available, Busy, Away, Offline
Implement status-based assignment logic
Add "Away" persistence (not marked offline on logout)
Build Escalation Flow in Flow Builder
Create "Escalate to Human" node
Add group routing logic
Implement context transfer
Add queue management
Add Auto-Assignment Logic
Based on: Availability, Concurrency, Last assigned time
Priority routing for escalated chats
Skill-based routing within groups
POSITIVE FLOW - What Should Work
Your platform should handle this flow smoothly:
1. Customer starts chat → AI Agent responds
2. AI cannot resolve → Detects escalation intent
3. Check agent availability in appropriate group
4. If available → Transfer with context
5. Agent receives chat with full history
6. Agent resolves or transfers to another agent
7. Chat marked resolved with required fields
Current Blockers:
No group-based routing
No context transfer mechanism
No agent availability check before escalation
No queue fallback
