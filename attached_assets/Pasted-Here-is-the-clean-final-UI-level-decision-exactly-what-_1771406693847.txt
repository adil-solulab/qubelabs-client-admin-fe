Here is the clean, final UI-level decision + exactly what should be removed or changed after eliminating channel selection during flow creation.
✅ UI-Level Impact After Removing “Select Channel While Creating Flow”
Before (Old)
When creating a flow, the popup contained:
Flow Name
Description
Category
Channel selection (Voice / Chat / Email / WhatsApp etc.) ❌
This created confusion because:
Early channel selection forced users to think about channels too early
They assumed flows cannot be reused
They thought workflows are channel-bound
They expected unified intelligence across channels (your 4-layer architecture)
🎯 After (New) — What the UI Flow Should Become
⭐ Step 1: “Create Flow” Popup (Simplified)
Remove the “Select Channel” field entirely.
KEEP only:
Flow Name
Flow Description
Category (optional)
ADD (new helpful hint):
“A flow can be used for multiple channels. Channel-specific formatting happens inside the flow.”
👉 This aligns with your 4-layer architecture
👉 Reduces user confusion instantly
⭐ Step 2: Inside Flow Builder (New UI Behaviour)
What changes inside the canvas:
Instead of selecting channels at creation time…
🔥 Users should see a “Channel Nodes Palette” on the left toolbar, e.g.:
Channel Nodes
Voice Output Node
Chat Output Node
Email Output Node
WhatsApp Output Node
SMS Output Node
These nodes define HOW the response should be formatted & delivered.
The user journey becomes:
Create a flow (channel-neutral).
Add logic nodes, conditions, prompts, workflows (all channel-neutral).
At the point of output, the user drags a channel node:
Voice Node → SSML formatting
Chat Node → buttons, quick replies, text
Email Node → long-form templates
WhatsApp Node → limited button options
Flow becomes multi-channel automatically.
⭐ Step 3: Where Workflows Appear
No change needed — workflows stay channel-independent.
But in UI, you should show:
Workflow Nodes under “Actions / Integrations”
CRM API Call
Create Ticket
Send Data to DB
Trigger Zapier
etc.
Workflows connect to the flow logic and feed data back to channel nodes.
⭐ Step 4: Channel Preview Section (Optional but Powerful)
Inside the flow, when clicking an output node:
Show tabs:
Voice Preview
Chat Preview
Email Preview
WhatsApp Preview
This makes it clear that one flow = many channels.
🗑️ What Should Be Removed Entirely (UI Level)
Remove these elements from the UI:
❌ 1. Channel selection during “Create Flow”
This field becomes misleading.
❌ 2. Channel filter dropdowns that imply flows are channel-specific
Rename filters to:
“Filter by Channel Output Used”
instead of “Flow Channel”.
❌ 3. Channel icons next to flow list
(Unless these icons dynamically list which channel nodes exist inside the flow — optional)
Currently it shows:
Voice
Chat
Email
Remove this if it implies one flow = one channel.
❌ 4. Any copy that says “Choose your channel for this flow”
Replace with:
“Define channel outputs inside the flow canvas.”
🧠 Final UX Philosophy (Client-Friendly)
You’re moving the platform from:
Old
Flow-level channels = rigid, confusing
to
New
Node-level channels = flexible, multi-channel, intelligent
This perfectly supports your orchestration layer and 4-layer architecture.
