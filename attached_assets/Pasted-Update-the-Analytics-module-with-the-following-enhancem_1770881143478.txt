Update the Analytics module with the following enhancements. 
Keep the architecture modular, scalable, and aligned with the existing UI.

====================================

- Widgets should render in a responsive grid layout
- Store user preferences (local storage or backend)
- Allow future extensibility for role-based dashboards

On the main dashboard:
- Add a “Dive Deep” button near KPI cards
- Clicking it should redirect to the full Analytics page
- Ensure routing works without breaking existing dashboard logic

====================================
