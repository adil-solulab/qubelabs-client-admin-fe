Here’s a professional review + recommendations based on the screenshot you shared of your Safety Check Node inside your flow builder.
I’ve analyzed the image fully — here is the breakdown.
✅ Overall Assessment
Your Safety Check node setup is good, but it can be made much stronger depending on:
1️⃣ The use-case
2️⃣ Whether the bot is customer-facing or internal
3️⃣ Whether calls are voice or chat
4️⃣ Your business’s compliance rules (PII, sentiment, safety)
Right now you are using default / generic safety configurations, which is okay — but not optimized.
🔍 Detailed Review of Each Sub-Function
Below I’m reviewing each component the UI is showing:
① Sentiment Analysis — ON
Good, but recommended tuning:
✔ Keep On
⚠️ Adjust Threshold
Suggested:
Flag negative + mixed
Trigger escalation on repeated negative sentiment
For voice workflows: sentiment should check both tone + content.
➡️ Consider adding a rule:
If sentiment is negative twice in last 3 messages → escalate or route to empathy flow
② PII Detection — ON
This is good but depends on your vertical.
You have these PII categories selected:
Credit Card, SSN, Phone, Email, Address
✨ Recommended Improvements:
Add Name if required
Add Government ID if relevant
Add Date of Birth if compliance-heavy
➡️ Also check your business region → compliance differs by geography (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).
③ Policy Violation — ON
Recommended to keep ON.
🔧 Add refinement:
If your bot is for customer support, include categories:
Harassment
Threats
Abuse
If your bot is for commerce, include categories:
Fraud
Scams
If your bot is for internal use, include:
Data leakage
Internal confidential content
④ Profanity Filter — ON
Good.
⚠️ Suggest tuning:
If it's a customer service bot → mildly filter, DO NOT block the flow
If it's a public-facing website bot → strong filter recommended
You may want to add a grace count, e.g.:
First profanity — warn
Second — restrict or escalate
⑤ Topic Guardrail — Off
This is off in your screenshot, but this is VERY powerful.
Recommended: Turn ON
Use this to prevent the bot from answering on topics like:
Medical advice
Legal advice
Sexual content
Violence
Politics
You can customize allowed vs disallowed topics.
This makes your bot safer and reduces hallucinations.
⑥ Anger / Frustration Threshold — Medium
"Medium" is okay for normal CS bots.
But I recommend:
Voice Bots: Set to Low (voice tone has more frustration cues)
Text Bots: Medium is fine
Support Escalation Bots: Set to High to avoid unnecessary escalations
⑦ Risk Actions
You have:
On High Risk → Escalate to Supervisor
On Medium Risk → Continue with Warning
On PII Detected → Mask Data & Continue
These are correct default behaviors, BUT:
Suggested Enhancements
On High Safety Risk
Instead of always escalating, consider:
First occurrence → ask clarifying question
Second → escalate
On PII Detected
Good, but also log the event for compliance.
Your UI has Audit Logging = ON which is correct.
⑧ Custom Rules Section
This is the MOST important area people ignore.
Suggested additions:
“If user mentions refund + anger → escalate immediately”
“If user mentions cancel account + negative sentiment → route to retention agent”
“If user mentions competitor → route to sales agent”
“If user asks a forbidden topic → predefined response + block”
“If bot detects hallucination risk → fallback to safe scripted message”
💡 Recommended Final Safety Node Configuration (Best Practices)
Here is the ideal setup:
🔷 Turn ON
Sentiment
PII (all relevant types)
Profanity
Policy guardrails
Topic guardrails
Audit logging
🔷 Thresholds
Anger/frustration → Low for voice, Medium for chat
PII → Mask + Continue (never escalate unless required)
🔷 Risk Actions
High Risk → First warn → then escalate
Medium Risk → Continue with disclaimer
Sensitive Topic → Safe fallback
PII → Mask + continue
🔷 Custom Rules (important)
Add at least 4–5 business-specific rules.
✔ YES — You should modify it
Right now you are using mostly default toggles, which work, but don’t protect you enough depending on your business use case.
I recommend enabling:
✔ Topic guardrails
✔ More PII categories
✔ Some custom escalation logic
✔ Better thresholds for frustration
✔ Custom safety rules
